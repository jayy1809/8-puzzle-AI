# 8-puzzle-AI
This is Artificial Intelligence project which solves the 8-puzzle problem using DFS

# Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of solving the classic 8-puzzle problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to reach a specific configuration by sliding the tiles into the empty space.

# Features
DFS Solver: A Depth-First Search algorithm is employed to explore the state space, searching for a solution to the 8-puzzle problem.
BFS Solver: Additionally, a Breadth-First Search algorithm is implemented for solving the 8-puzzle problem, exploring the state space in a breadth-first manner.

# Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jayy1809/8-puzzle-AI.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd 8-puzzle-AI
